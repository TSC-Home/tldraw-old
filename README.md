This repository contains the source code for [old.tldraw.com](https://old.tldraw.com). It hosts the original [tldraw version](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-old-www), which was previously hosted at [tldraw.com](https://tldraw.com).

You can use this site to:

- take a nostalgic tour through the old version of tldraw
- open and edit .tldr files that were created with the old version
- view multiplayer rooms that were created with the old version

Looking for the _new_ tldraw? That's [here!](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw)

## A note on .tldr files

This website can only open .tldr files that were created with the original version of tldraw. It cannot open _new_ files created at tldraw.com (or from beta.tldraw.com).

## A note on multiplayer rooms

The multiplayer rooms are a "snapshot" of our servers at the moment that we switched to the new version of tldraw. These files are presented as "readonly" documents in the editor. If you would like to edit a file from a multiplayer room, you can download it as a .tldr file (Menu > File > Save As...) and then open it at old.tldraw.com (Menu > File > Open...).

## Support
